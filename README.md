<h1> Hi, I'm Avril !</h1>

I'm a Software Engineer from New York City and I currently attend The New York City School of Technology as a Computer Information Systems major. 
I enjoy programming because it encourages me to be innovative, creative and a problem solver. 
It requires me to think outside of the box and motivates me to keep learning since technology is continuously evolving. 
I look forward to implementing the skills that I have gained and finding where I fit best in this amazing world of Computer Science.
