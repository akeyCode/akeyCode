# Hey, I'm Avril and I'm a Software Engineer from Queens, NY! 	:butterfly::nazar_amulet:

I enjoy programming because it encourages me to be innovative, creative and a problem solver. It requires 
me to think outside of the box and motivates me to keep learning since technology
is continuously evolving. I'm currently on the self-taught path to **Fullstack Engineering**.
