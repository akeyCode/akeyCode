# Hi, I'm Avril !

I'm a **Software Engineer** based in New York City I enjoy programming because 
it encourages me to be innovative, creative and a problem solver. It requires 
me to think outside of the box and motivates me to keep learning since technology
is continuously evolving. 

I attend the New York City College of Technology but I'm currently on the 
self-taught path to Fullstack (MERN) Engineering.
